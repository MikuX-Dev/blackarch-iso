# Overview

This is the README file providing basic info on where you can find things as
well as provide helpful links for further information on the contents of this
repository.

## All ISOs

* Full ISO
  *  The largest of the ISOs and installs *all* tools
* NetInstall ISO
  *  The smallest ISO and allows you to selectively install tools
* Slim ISO
  *   The newest ISO, by default is configured with XFCE4 and LightDM

## How the ISO is built

the ISO is built with the archiso tool that can be downloaded from the official
arch repositories.

## File structure
```
Profile
 |- airootfs/
 |- efiboot/
 |- syslinux/
 |- packages.ARCH
 |- pacman.conf
 \- profiledef.sh

ARCH = x86_64
```

#### packages.ARCH

All files must be listed one per line. lines that are blank are ignored and so
are lines commented out with `#` the packages **mkinitcpio** and **mkinitcpio-archiso**
are mandatory see [issue #30](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archiso/-/issues/30)

#### pacman.conf

A configuration for pacman is required per profile. Some configuration options
will not be used or will be modified:


* CacheDir: the profile's option is only used if it is not the default (i.e.
  /var/cache/pacman/pkg) and if it is not the same as the system's option. In
  all other cases the system's pacman cache is used.

* HookDir: it is always set to the /etc/pacman.d/hooks directory in the work
  directory's airootfs to allow modification via the profile and ensure
  interoparability with hosts using dracut ([see #73](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archiso/-/issues/73))

* RootDir: it is always removed, as setting it explicitely otherwise refers to
  the host's root filesystem (see man 8 pacman for further information on the -r
  option used by pacstrap)

* LogFile: it is always removed, as setting it explicitely otherwise refers to
  the host's pacman log file (see man 8 pacman for further information on the -r
  option used by pacstrap)

* DBPath: it is always removed, as setting it explicitely otherwise refers to
  the host's pacman database (see man 8 pacman for further information on the -r
  option used by pacstrap)

#### airootfs directory

This is the directory that holdes any files that will be put into the `/etc`
directory, as such you can add or modifty files by placing them inside the
corresponding directory.

###### example

```
|- airootfs
\- etc
  \- hosts
```

Aany files will by default have the the 644 permissions and directories will
have the 755 permissions. this can be changed in `profiledef.sh`

With this overlay structure it is possible to e.g. create users and set
passwords for them, by providing airootfs/etc/passwd, airootfs/etc/shadow,
airootfs/etc/gshadow (see man 5 passwd, man 5 shadow and man 5 gshadow
respectively).

If user home directories exist in the profile's airootfs, their
ownership and (and top-level) permissions will be
altered according to the provided information in the password file.

#### Bootloader configuration

The profile may contain several boot loaders. They are explained in the
following subsetions

###### efiboot directory

This directory is mandatory when the uefi-x64.systemd-boot.esp or
uefi-x64.systemd-boot.eltorito bootmodes are selected in profiledef.sh. It
contains configuration for
[systemd-boot](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/).

The custom template identifiers are only understood in the boot loader entry
`.conf` files *(i.e. not in loader.conf).*

###### syslinux direcotry

This directory is mandatory when the bios.syslinux.mbr or the
bios.syslinux.eltorito bootmodes are selected in profiledef.sh. It contains
configuration files for syslinux or isolinux , or pxelinux used in the resuling
image. The custom template identifiers are understood in all `.cfg` files in
this directory.


# BlackArch Specific info

This section is for finding info specific to the BlackArch ISO repos

## Tools/Misc Info

## Tools directory

This directory contains a compilation of tools used by some of the devs for
working with the ISO

## misc directory

Contains certain files for development as well as a list of disabled tools.
Plus the upstream packages

## etc directory

This contains basic info that will be placed in the `/etc` directory. it
contains the preconfigured hosts file, hostname file as well as systemd
configurations, lightdm configurations, and will also hold xfce4 configurations
and calamares configurations when they are installed. the configurations are
located in the corresponding repositories which will be linked now. there will
be more repositories linked that come in the NetInstall ISO and the Full ISO

## root directory

This holds some scripts for configuring the build and should not be modfied
unless you have knowledge of how the `archiso` tool works

## /usr/share directory

This holds the backgrounds and icons for the various builds of the ISOs

# Further info

Further info can be found within the files themselves which will be commented
and documented properly as time goes on.
